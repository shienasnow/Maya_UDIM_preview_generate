# Maya_UDIM_texture_preview_generate
Automates the creation of all texture file previews that belong to the selected group in Maya's Viewport when you use udim for textures.


### How to use

Place both files in the path below, depending on the operating system.
Window : C:\Users\admin\Documents\maya\2022\scripts\
Linux : /home/{username}/maya/2022/scripts/

1. Select a group.
2. Click the Create Preview button created in CustomTools in the shelf.
- If a group is not selected, a warning window pops up if there is no mesh within the selected group.
- If the workspace of the file is not appropriate (when textures cannot be retrieved to the relative path), a warning window pops up.
